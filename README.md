This project is designed to work with the online learning system for the school I'm employed for but should work anywhere that allows embeds

## Usage

Load up the editor [here](https://milankarman.github.io/Embed-Web-Playground/) or on your own host. Then you can write your HTML and CSS. You can switch between languages by clicking the language name, which will show a dropdown. If you want to share your code you can hit the blue link icon in the top right that will copy the URL to your clipboard - which you can then share or place in an iframe element.

Your code isn't hosted or logged anywhere, it's encoded in a URL parameter. This means the project doesn't need a database or anything else. This does mean the amount of code is limited to the maximum URL size that your browser supports. Take care that this project is **not designed for security**, don't embed URLs you don't trust.
